1.1 INTRODUCTION ABOUT THE PROJECT:  A smart home incorpates sensors, actuators, middleware,and a network and has two major interacting components which is a smart network and a smart load. The Smart home known as House automation or Home Automation, with the use of new technology, to make the domestic activities more convenient, comfortable, secure and economical. The Internet of things can be defined as connecting the various types of objects like smart phones, personal computer and Tablets to internet, which brings in very newfangled type of communication between things and people and also between things. With the introduction of IoTs, the research and development of home automation are becoming popular in the recent days. Many of the devices are controlled and monitored for helps the human being. Additionally various wireless technologies help in connecting from remote places to improve the intelligence of home environment. An advanced network of IoT is being formed when a human being is in need of connecting with other things. IoTs technology is used to come in with innovative idea and great growth for smart homes to improve the living standards of life. Internet helps us to bring in with immediate solution for many problems and also able to connect from any of the remote places which contributes to overall cost reduction and energy consumption.

1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT: Nowadays, people with the hectic daily life routine sometimes makes them forgetful to switch off the devices at home. As a human being we can’t run from the clumsiness attitude plus with our packed daily routine life that sometimes makes ourselves such in hurry situation that sometimes makes us forgot to switch off the lamps. It will cause the electricity bill rose sharply. Besides, it is one of the electricity wastages that will lead the earth to become an unhealthy one. Besides, the elderly and the handicapped user faced problem to manually access control of devices like light, fan etc. instead of automation process. Lastly, no one is aware of luxurious property before lost. If there is a CCTV installed, they can see the footage after lost but cannot inform or notify before lost or at the time of occurrence. This means we think we have a high security. But it is a low security one.

1.3 OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT: The main objective of this project is to control the devices such as lamp, fan, door etc. at home using smartphone.
To design one system that is related with home appliances using NODEMCU which can be control using mobile application from anywhere around the world and that can be installed at every home and office at lowest possible cost.
To implement a home appliance that can help user to control the devices at home.
To develop a good condition of house area that will prevent any loss and damage to the property of any organization.
To view the status of home appliances on the application.
To save the electricity, there is a timer mode for a device by selecting the time. After the time is over, that device will be auto off.
To get the notification of a sensor data. For example, notification will be sent to the user if -
someone enters to his/her private area.
his/her room temperature is high or low.
there is a leakage in gas and many more.

1.4 PROJECT FOCUS: Project has focus on two main area of home which are electricity and security, and come up with two solutions: -
I. Smart Switch with timer based.
II. Notification based on Sensor’s values.

1.5 ORGANIZATION OF REPORT:  The entire Project is composed of five chapters. each covering a section of work as summarized below:
• Chapter one introduces automation as a whole and the different types of
automation. And define project objectives and problem statements.
• Chapter two covers an extensive background overview of project working and which technology are involved in development with establishment of standards and protocols and benefits.
• Chapter three highlights the project methodology, and comprehensive details on project development timeline.
• Chapter four is on the system design with DFD, ERD, Circuit Diagram, Flow Chart and Block Diagram.
• Chapter five is on the project testing and implementation with clear practical details of the project design, construction, testing, microcontroller coding and debugging. Special emphasis is also made on the flexibility and scalability of the project work with real life illustration.
• Last chapter is on the conclusion and recommendations based on the project work with emphasis on the reliability, maintainability, and flexibility of the design. Also, recommendations based on the challenges encountered and further possible development of the project work.
